Python library for Tolkien-related data processing

This project is in its early stages and currently just has an initial
implementation of `Year` and `YearDelta` classes for dealing with Ages.

See `test.rst` for an example.

## Development

Install the dev dependencies in `Pipfile`.

Then run `test.sh` to test or `lint.sh` to lint.
